# 💘 GITAMOUR

> Where commits lead to commitment.

GitAmour is a completely serious, scientifically questionable,
romantically interpretive Git-based dating engine.

It analyzes your repository to determine:

- 🔥 Passion (late night commits)
- 📝 Communication (README quality)
- ✅ Responsibility (tests)
- 🌿 Relationship style (branch strategy)
- ✨ Conflict resolution (merge behavior)
- 🌈 Personality (language diversity)

Because your repo **is** your dating profile.

## 🧸 Foster Mode

Not every repository is ready for prime time.

Some repos:
- Have no README.
- Have no tests.
- Haven’t been committed to in years.
- Carry complicated merge history.

GitAmour includes **Foster Mode** — where stable, emotionally available
hackers can gently nurture neglected side projects back to health.

You don’t fix them.

You refactor them with patience.

## 🚀 Usage

Run inside any git repository:

```bash
python3 gitamour.py
