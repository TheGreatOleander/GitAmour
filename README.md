# 💘 GITAMOUR

> Where commits lead to commitment.

GitAmour is a completely serious, scientifically questionable, romantically interpretive Git-based dating engine.

It analyzes your repository to determine:

- 🔥 Passion (late night commits)
- 📝 Communication (README quality)
- ✅ Responsibility (tests)
- 🌿 Relationship style (branch strategy)
- ✨ Conflict resolution (merge behavior)
- 🌈 Personality (language diversity)

Because your repo **is** your dating profile.

## 🧸 Foster Mode

Not every repository is ready for prime time.

Some repos:
- Have no README.
- Have no tests.
- Haven’t been committed to in years.
- Carry complicated merge history.

GitAmour includes **Foster Mode** — where stable, emotionally available hackers can gently nurture neglected side projects back to health.

You don’t fix them.

You refactor them with patience.

## 🚀 Usage

Run inside any git repository:

```bash
python3 gitamour.py
```

If you are not in a repository:

```bash
git init
echo "# Looking for love" > README.md
```

Then try again.

## 💡 What Improves Your Score?

- Late night commits = dedication 🔥  
- Clean merges = emotional maturity ✨  
- Tests = responsibility ✅  
- Detailed README = communication 📝  
- Multiple languages = open-minded 🌈

## 🧠 Philosophy

GitAmour is satire.

But also not entirely.

Your commit history tells a story:
- How you work.
- How you resolve conflict.
- How you document.
- How you persist.

And sometimes…

That’s more honest than a dating bio.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

GitAmour does not:
- Guarantee romantic success
- Fix your attachment style
- Automatically improve your README

But it might make you laugh.
And possibly write better documentation.

Which is basically the same thing.

💖 Commit often.  
💬 Document clearly.  
🧪 Test responsibly.  
🌿 Merge gently.
