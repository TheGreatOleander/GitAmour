# 💘 GITAMOUR

> *A love letter to your repository.*

**GITAMOUR** is a playful, sincere command‑line companion for developers who believe code can carry emotion, ritual, and care.

This is not a joke repo.
This is not a productivity hack.
This is **romantic infrastructure**.

## 🌹 Why GITAMOUR Exists

Developers spend thousands of hours with their repositories.
We name them.
We nurture them.
We return to them late at night.

GITAMOUR makes that relationship explicit.

It adds poetry, encouragement, and ceremony to the everyday act of committing code—without breaking workflows or professionalism.
